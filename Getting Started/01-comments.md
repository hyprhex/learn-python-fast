# 1. What and why we need comment?
---
Comment is non executable text, 
It's just a note for you or other to understand what you are doing
# 2. Types of comment
---
There's 3 types to write comment in python:

1. Single-line comment
Adding `#` before line example: 
```python
# Print 'welcome' to the screen 
print("Welcome")
``` 

2. Inline-comment 
Use Inline comment just for quick annotation example:
```python
name = 'Aipills' # assign string value to 'name'
```

3. Multiline comment
There's two ways to create multiline comment in `Python`

- **First way**: Is just adding `#` for each line 

Example: 
```python 
# First comment 
# Second comment 
print('Hash character way')
```

- **Second way**: write your comment inside triple quotes `"""`

Example:
```python
""" The second way of writing comment use it as docstring and explain your code and you can write with it as much as you can """
print('Triple quotes')
```
